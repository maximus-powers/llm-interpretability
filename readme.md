# Todo

* Evaluation pipeline
    - Inference class
    - Evaluation scripts
* Figure out what signature method I want to use. Training is really expensive so need to make it count. Test various with label classification instead of modification. Will save $.
* Train 4 interpreters
    1. Single pattern, task: single-label classification
    2. Multiple patterns, task: multi-label classification
    3. Single pattern, task: model modification
    4. Multi pattern, task: model modification
