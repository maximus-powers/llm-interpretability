# SIGNATURE EXTRACTION CONFIGURATION
# ============================================================================
# Design of the neuron activation signatures used to interpret the subject models
# It's important that all the training data for an interpreter model uses the same signature design, including the underlying signature dataset, and neuron profiling config.
# This element of the prompt is what the interpreter should learn to use as a key to understanding the subject model's weights.

signature:
  dataset_path: "exp_1/signature_dataset.json" # path to the signature dataset file
  
  # Neuron profiling methods - determines what statistical features are extracted for each neuron.
  # Picking the right set of methods is crucial for creating informative signatures, but picking too many explodes the size of the signature.
  # Comment out methods you don't want to use to reduce signature size.
  # These methods all aggregate the activations across examples in the signature dataset.
